A press-ganged bioengineer struggles to prove her worth in an organic city withering from siege. 

### One Paragraph

Katya is a travelling organic architect: she cultivates complex networks of flora and fauna, shaping them to fulfill the needs of the communities who hire her. While on the outskirts of Peregrinstedd, the crawling city, city officials hire her to mend the city’s scuttling claws. While working, she notices something is off, slowly discovering that two invading armies will soon clash around the city. When she finishes the job and attempts to leave, the city press-gangs her into continued service. She joins a covert cultivator’s rebellion that tries to escape by hijacking the city’s organic systems, but realizes the attempt would doom the civilians and betrays it at the last moment. The aborted rebellion cripples the city, and now has no chance to flee, stranded on the banks of an inlet. Katya joins Peregrinstedd’s Chancery as the senior-most remaining cultivator and helps organize the defense. The Chancery devises a plan to arm the city and bluff each opposing army into believing Peregrinstedd will join the other side, but while each army believes them, they are so desperate they fight anyway. A massive battle of swords, rifles, and organic weaponry ensues, which forces the city to defend itself. Katya and one other are in nominal control, and jerry-rig Peregrinstedd’s defenses just in time to drive the city into the bay, where it slowly floats away, safe from pillage but forever changed.
