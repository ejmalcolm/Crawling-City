### Setting

Biopunk, thirty-years-war era siege novel set in a living, mobile city. 150 years ago, the world was struck by the Flowering from first contact with a foreign continent dominated by jungle (lenamor?), causing accelerated (Lamarckian?) evolution in many forms of flora and fauna. Cultivators, a caste of trained bioengineers, have risen up to harness the potential of the new world.

### One Sentence

A press-ganged bioengineer struggles to prove her worth in an organic city withering from siege.

### One Paragraph

Katya is a travelling organic architect: she cultivates complex networks of flora and fauna, shaping them to fulfill the needs of the communities who hire her. While on the outskirts of Peregrinstedd, the crawling city, city officials hire her to mend the city’s scuttling claws. While working, she notices something is off, slowly discovering that two invading armies will soon clash around the city. When she finishes the job and attempts to leave, the city press-gangs her into continued service. She joins a covert cultivator’s rebellion that tries to escape by hijacking the city’s organic systems, but realizes the attempt would doom the civilians and betrays it at the last moment. The aborted rebellion cripples the city, and now has no chance to flee, stranded on the banks of an inlet. Katya joins Peregrinstedd’s Chancery as the senior-most remaining cultivator and helps organize the defense. The Chancery devises a plan to arm the city and bluff each opposing army into believing Peregrinstedd will join the other side, but while each army believes them, they are so desperate they fight anyway. A massive battle of swords, rifles, and organic weaponry ensues, which forces the city to defend itself. Katya and one other are in nominal control, and jerry-rig Peregrinstedd’s defenses just in time to drive the city into the bay, where it slowly floats away, safe from pillage but forever changed.

### Take several hours and expand each sentence of your summary paragraph into a full paragraph. All but the last paragraph should end in a disaster. The final paragraph should tell how the book ends.

### Take a day or two and write up a one-page description of each major character and a half-page description of the other important characters. These “character synopses” should tell the story from the point of view of each character

### Now take a week and expand the one-page plot synopsis of the novel to a four-page synopsis. Basically, you will again be expanding each paragraph from step (4) into a full page.

### Take another week and expand your character descriptions into full-fledged character charts detailing everything there is to know about each character. The standard stuff such as birthdate, description, history, motivation, goal, etc. Most importantly, how will this character change by the end of the novel?

### Make a list of all the scenes that you’ll need to turn the story into a novel. Use a spreadsheet w/ chapter number, POV character, what happens in the scene, what the conflict is, what is being progressed by the scene, and any cool lines of dialogue or moments you want to include.

### Actually write it.
